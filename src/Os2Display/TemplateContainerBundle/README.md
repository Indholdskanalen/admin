# Purpose of this bundle

The purpose of this bundle is to ease the transition to the Bundle based
structure.

If the only extension from the base installation is som templates, that
previously was placed in web/templates/, these files can not be cloned into
this bundle's Resources/public/templates/ folder. Any files in this folder
will be ignored by git.
